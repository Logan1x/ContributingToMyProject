# Contributing to Drupal


## What is Drupal 
Drupal is content management software.  
It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day.  
Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security.  
But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles.
